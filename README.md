Get the marble past the various obstacles and enemies any way you can.

There is only one rule: do not run out of time.

Yes, you can be a duck, or a clover, or something else - in any colour you like.

<h2>₿ <a href="https://github.com/ducksplash/WalletSentinel">Wallet Sentinel</a></h2>
<i>A small Web3.js programme to monitor wallets on various ethereum-based blockchains and forward all incoming funds to another address.  This is a proof of concept programme borne out of pure curiosity</i>

![Screenshot 2021-11-26 02 23 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11778864/143518798-64f019e4-0b4d-4389-a018-edb4105ff292.png)

Wallet Sentinel is now hosted live on the Polygon-Matic network!
  
  <a href="http://walletsentinel.dao">WalletSentinel.dao</a> <b>(!)</b>
  
  <b>(!)</b> The address above is a new type of domain known as an <b>"Unstoppable Domain"</b> which can ironically be stopped without the <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension">necessary browser extension</a>.
  
  Decidedly sub-tremendous; I'll hold off on abandoning traditional HTTP for the mean time ;P 
  
  If you don't fancy a whole browser extension just to view a one-pager, here's <a href="https://bafybeibcymhvludsay2fk5kj2y7z5zchiwbenamz6xfa5qrg44uv63aqv4.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io">a direct IPFS-TO-HTTP link</a>.
  
  If you actually want to play about with this, you will need an Ethereum, Matic, Fantom or Binance Smart Chain wallet (address & private key) with testnet funds in it.
